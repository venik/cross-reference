# Machine Learning courses/books/etc

## Books
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
  * covers statistical learning without too much exposure to math (originally course was designed for the MBA students).
  * good explanation of the bias-variance dilemma.
  * good explanation of linear and logistic regression with examples and comparison with kNN, LDA, QDA (linear/quadratic discriminant analysis).

[Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
  * just *the best* book about deep learning at that moment.
 
[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd edition](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto
  * bible of the reinforcement learning, a bit outdated but super good.

## ML Courses

## Some math courses that help to understand ML
[MIT 18.06: Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) with video
  * just well designed course about linear algebra (matrix factorizations, SVD, PCA, etc).

[MIT 6.041 / 6.431: Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/) with video
  * really good introduction into probability.

[Real Analysis course at Harvey Mudd College (follows baby Rudin)](http://analysisyawp.blogspot.com/) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0E754696F72137EC)

## Magazines/Articles
[Journal of Machine Learning Research](http://www.jmlr.org/)
  * highly respected scholar magazine with free access
  
[arxiv.org with Machine Learning tag](https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent)
  * archive of pre-prints, you can checkout papers of such giants like [Yoshua Bengio](https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Bengio_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Andrew Y. Ng](https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ng_A/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Yann LeCun](https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+LeCun_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://arxiv.org/find/stat/1/au:+Scholkopf_B/0/1/0/all/0/1), etc.

[Articles of DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/)
  * The best recommendation is a cite from wiki - ["The company made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player for the first time"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind)
